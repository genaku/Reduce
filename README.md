# Reduce

Concise reactive state container library for Android applications based on Kotlin coroutines.

# Inspiration
Reduce was inspired by awesome project
* Knot https://github.com/beworker/knot

But it is written for RxJava. I decided to write it based on Kotlin corutines.

# Concept

Reduce helps managing application state by reacting on events and performing asynchronous actions in a structured way. There are five core concepts Knot defines: `State`, `Intent`, `Action`, `Reducer` and `Effect`.

<img src="docs/knot_diagram.png" width="621" />

`State` represents an immutable state of an application. It can be a state of a screen or a state of an internal statefull headless component.

`Intent` is an immutable data object with an optional payload intended for changing the `State`. A `Intent` can be produced from an external source or be a result of execution of an `Action`.

`Action` is a synchronous or an asynchronous operation which, when completed, can – but doesn't have to – emit a new `Intent`.

`Reducer` is a function that takes the previous `State` and a `Intent` as arguments and returns the new `State` and an optional `Action`s wrapped by the `Effect` class. `Reducer` in Knot is designed to stay side-effects free because each side-effect can be turned into an `Action` and returned from the reducer function together with a new state in a pure way.

`Effect` is a convenient wrapper class containing the new `State` and a list of `Action`s. If list of `Action`s is not empty, Knot will perform it and provide resulting `Intent` (if any) back to the `Reducer`.

# Getting Started

The example below declares a Knot capable of loading data, handling *Success* and *Failure* loading results and reloading data automatically when an external *"data changed"* signal gets received. It also logs all `State` mutations as well as all processed `Intents` and `Actions` in console.

```kotlin
sealed class BooksState : State {
    object Empty : BooksState()
    object Loading : BooksState()
    data class Content(val books: List<Book>) : BooksState()
    data class BooksError(val message: String) : BooksState()
}

sealed class BooksIntent : StateIntent {
    object Load : BooksIntent()
    class Success(val books: List<Book>) : BooksIntent()
    class Failure(val message: String) : BooksIntent()
}

sealed class BooksAction : Action {
    object Load : BooksAction()
}

val knot = knot<BooksState, BooksIntent, BooksAction> {

    initialState = BooksState.Empty

    reduce { intent ->
        when (intent) {
            BooksIntent.Load -> when (this) {
                BooksState.Empty,
                is BooksState.Content,
                is BooksState.BooksError -> BooksState.Loading + BooksAction.Load
                else -> stateOnly
            }
            is BooksIntent.Success -> when (this) {
                BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.Content(intent.books).stateOnly
                else -> unexpected(intent)
            }
            is BooksIntent.Failure ->  when (this) {
                BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.BooksError(intent.message).stateOnly
                else -> unexpected(intent)
            }
        }
    }

    actions { action ->
        when (action) {
            BooksAction.Load -> {
                repository.loadBooks().toIntent()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how inside the `reduce` function a new `State` can be combined with an `Action` using `+` operator. If only the `State` value should be returned from the reducer, the `.stateOnly` suffix is added to the `State`.

# Composition

If your knot becomes complex and you want to improve its readability and maintainability, you may consider to write a composite knot. You start composition by grouping related functionality into, in a certain sense, indecomposable pieces called `Delegates`. Each `Delegate` is isolated from the other `Delegates`. It defines its own set of `Intents`, `Actions` and `Reducers`. It's only the `State`, what is shared between the `Delegates`. In that respect each `Delegate` can be seen as a separate `Knot` working on a shared `State`.

<img src="docs/delegated_knot_diagram.png" width="961" />

```kotlin
    private val commonState = CoroutineKnotState<BooksState>(BooksState.Empty)

    private val clearKnot = knot<BooksState, ClearBookIntent, ClearBooksAction> {

        knotState = commonState

        reduce { intent ->
            when (intent) {
                ClearBookIntent.Clear -> when (this) {
                    is BooksState.Content -> BooksState.Empty.stateOnly
                    is BooksState.Empty -> stateOnly
                    else -> unexpected(intent)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private val loadKnot = knot<BooksState, BooksIntent, BooksAction> {

        knotState = commonState

        reduce { intent ->
            when (intent) {
                BooksIntent.Load -> when (this) {
                    BooksState.Empty,
                    is BooksState.Content,
                    is BooksState.BooksError -> BooksState.Loading + BooksAction.Load
                    else -> stateOnly
                }
                is BooksIntent.Success -> when (this) {
                    BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.Content(intent.books).stateOnly
                    else -> unexpected(intent)
                }
                is BooksIntent.Failure ->  when (this) {
                    BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.BooksError(intent.message).stateOnly
                    else -> unexpected(intent)
                }
            }
        }

        actions { action ->
            when (action) {
                BooksAction.Load -> {
                    repository.loadBooks().toIntent()
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

# Scalability

Through 'performActions()' part single knots can be combined together.

<img src="docs/scalable_knot_diagram.png" width="477" />

# Simplify

Raviola in his article [A case against the MVI architecture pattern](https://dev.to/feresr/a-case-against-the-mvi-architecture-pattern-1add "A case against the MVI architecture pattern") raises issue about MVI pattern: hard to read code, you have to jump from reducer part to actions part and back. This library help to resolve the issue. Here you can join intent reduce with side effect action in one place.

```kotlin
...
 	easyKnot<BooksState, BooksIntent, BooksAction> {

        knotState = commonState

        reduce { intent ->
            when (intent) {
                BooksIntent.Load -> when (this) {
                    BooksState.Empty,
                    is BooksState.Content,
                    is BooksState.BooksError -> BooksState.Loading + SideEffect<BookIntent> {
						repository.loadBooks().toIntent()
					}
                    else -> stateOnly
                }
                is BooksIntent.Success -> when (this) {
                    BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.Content(intent.books).stateOnly
                    else -> unexpected(intent)
                }
                is BooksIntent.Failure ->  when (this) {
                    BooksState.Loading -> BooksState.BooksError(intent.message).stateOnly
                    else -> unexpected(intent)
                }
            }
        }
...
```
 Even several actions can be executed:
 ```kotlin
     easyKnot<TrafficState, TrafficIntent> {
        initialState = TrafficState.Off

        reduce { intent ->
            when (intent) {
                TrafficIntent.Minus -> {
                    if (cars > 0) {
                        cars--
                        this + startMovement()
                    } else {
                        stateOnly
                    }
                }
                TrafficIntent.Plus -> {
                    cars++
                    this + startMovement()
                }
                TrafficIntent.Off -> TrafficState.Off + close()
                TrafficIntent.On -> TrafficState.On + open() + startMovement()
            }
        }
    }

	private fun open() = SideEffect<TrafficIntent> {
        open.set(true)
        null
    }

    private fun close() = SideEffect<TrafficIntent> {
        open.set(false)
        null
    }

    private fun startMovement() = SideEffect<TrafficIntent> {
        if (moving.get()) return@SideEffect null
        moving.set(true)
        while (open.get() && cars > 0) {
            streetIn?.carOut()
            streetOut?.carIn()
            cars--
        }
        moving.set(false)
        null
    }
 ```

# Gradle

**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file.
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
**Step 2.** Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.genaku:Reduce:reduce-core:<version>'  // core of Reduce lib
    implementation 'com.github.genaku:Reduce:reduce-ext:<version>'   // Android extensions to connect reduce knots to activity/fragment lifecycle
}
```

# Why Reduce?

* Predictable - state is the single source of truth.
* Side-effect free reducer - by design.
* Scalable - single knots can be combined together to build more complex application logic.
* Composable - complex knots can be composed out of delegates grouped by related functionality.
* Structured - easy to read and write DSL for writing better structured and less buggy code.
* Concise - it has minimalistic API and compact implementation.
* Testable - reducers and transformers are easy to test.
* Why not?
